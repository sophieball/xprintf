These xprintf functions now support format specifiers %c, %d, %f, %i, %s, %u, %lu, and %ld. Sample usage is in test_xprintf.c

A queue of type queue_t is initialized by calling xprintf_init(). This queue is shared across threads. 

Producers can write to the queue and consumer prints out all messages stored in this queue in order to the FILE* stream. 

Producers write to the queue by calling xprintf(queue_t queue, char* format, ...). 
Consumer prints out the queue by calling xprintf_fini(queue_t queue, FILE* stream). This function also frees all allocated data.



Implementation note:
I first tried using va_copy() to save va_list, but it turned out that the value of va_list became unknown after exiting the function. Therefore I ended up parsing the input format and saving va_list one by one (as suggested by someone on stackoverflow). This may not be the most elegant solution. I have been trying to find a better way of doing this.
